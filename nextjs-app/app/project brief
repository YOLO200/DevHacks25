Project Brief: AI-Powered Medical Companion Platform

1. Vision

An AI-powered platform designed to support patients and their caregivers by improving communication, simplifying healthcare interactions, and ensuring seamless information sharing.

2. Target Users
	•	Patients: Individuals who need support in managing healthcare interactions, doctor visits, and daily medical records.
	•	Caregivers: Family members, professional caregivers, or medical aides responsible for monitoring and supporting patients.

3. Goals
	•	Empower patients with easy-to-use tools for recording and managing health information.
	•	Reduce caregiver burden by providing access to organized, reliable medical data.
	•	Improve continuity of care by bridging the communication gap between patients, caregivers, and doctors.

4. Core Features

For Patients
	•	Doctor Conversation Recording
	•	Record conversations during appointments.
	•	Upload existing audio files for processing and storage.
	•	Caregiver Management
	•	Add caregiver information (contact details, relationship, role).
	•	Data Sharing
	•	Share recordings and notes with caregivers via:
	•	Secure in-platform access.
	•	Email invitations/links.

For Caregivers
	•	Shared Dashboard
	•	View recordings and notes shared by the patient.
	•	Receive notifications of new uploads or updates.
	•	Care Coordination
	•	Track doctor visit history, shared tasks, and medical updates.
	•	Access Controls
	•	Ensure proper permissions (view-only vs. edit).

5. Platform Flow (High-Level)
	1.	Account Creation
	•	Patients and caregivers create distinct account types.
	•	Role-based dashboards are automatically configured.
	2.	Recording & Upload (Patient)
	•	Patient records or uploads a doctor conversation.
	•	Platform processes and organizes the audio file.
	3.	Caregiver Link
	•	Patient adds caregiver to their account.
	•	Shares selected recordings/notes.
	4.	Caregiver Access
	•	Caregiver logs in to view shared materials.
	•	Caregiver can track patient’s healthcare journey.

6. Differentiators
	•	Focused on patient accessibility (simple UI, voice-driven inputs, large fonts).
	•	Dual-user design (separate but connected experiences for patients and caregivers).
	•	AI-assisted organization of conversations (summaries, key highlights, reminders).

7. Next Steps
	•	Flesh out caregiver-specific features (e.g., task reminders, medication tracking, appointment coordination).
	•	Define technical requirements (AI transcription engine, security, compliance with HIPAA/GDPR).
	•	Prototype the patient and caregiver dashboards.
